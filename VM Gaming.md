Questions About Overall Experience

So to start, I'm new to VMs and Linux as a whole. I'd like to be using Windows for gaming and Linux for the usual day to day. I have no practical reason to do this, I've just always been interested in trying Linux but I still want to game with no issue.

I want to know how difficult it will be to use an iGPU strickly for Linux and the discrete gpu strictly for a Windows VM.

Also, I have several questions regarding the overall experience if done correctly. Such as, possible performance degradation due to assigning a thread to Linux, potential bugs/ issues, will reBar still work, do I use the display out on the mobo or the gpu, if it needs to go through the mobo i/o would that lower the frame rate/ resolution available to me, are there issues with game saves, and are there any known instances of using a Windows VM causing some sort of anti-cheat issue?



I'll have an Intel i5 11500 with a iGPU and an RX 6800. I can go with 32 GB of RAM to help ensure enough for each OS, and a separate SSD for each if that will help. I'd like to use Manjaro and Windows 10.


I'm sure this has all been gone over before, so forgive my ignorance. Thank you for any information.


Edit: Thank you all for the help. I genuinely appreciate it. Currently trying out a few distros with dual boot and once I decide on one I like the most I'll run Windows in a VM thanks to the advice given below. Again, thank you!
